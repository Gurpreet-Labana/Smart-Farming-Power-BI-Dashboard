# 🌱 Smart Farming Power BI Dashboard - Great Lakes Greenhouse

This Power BI project provides a dynamic, data-driven dashboard designed to help **Great Lakes Greenhouse** monitor and optimize crop yield, health, and farm operations using smart sensor data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard visualizes agricultural and environmental data from greenhouse farms to support data-driven decision-making. It enables greenhouse managers to:

- Monitor average crop yields and vegetation health
- Analyze the impact of irrigation methods and environmental factors
- Detect and localize crop disease outbreaks
- Track key performance indicators like crop cycle duration and NDVI

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Interactive Filters:** Region, Crop Type, Irrigation Method, Crop Disease Status
- **KPI Cards:**  
  - Average Yield (kg/hectare)  
  - NDVI Index  
  - Avg Temperature  
  - Crop Cycle Duration  
  - % of Farms with Severe Disease
- **Visuals Include:**
  - Yield by Region (Clustered Bar with conditional color)
  - NDVI vs Yield Scatter Plot
  - Impact of Irrigation on Yield (Clustered Column)
  - Crop Disease Distribution (Donut Chart)
  - Geo Map of Farms with Yield & Disease Info
  - Farm Performance Table with conditional formatting
