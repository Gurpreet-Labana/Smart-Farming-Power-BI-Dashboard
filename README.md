# 🌱 Smart Farming Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project built to showcase smart farming insights using sensor-based agricultural data. It is designed as a case study for Great Lakes Greenhouse and demonstrates how data-driven dashboards can help optimize crop yield, monitor plant health, and improve farm operations.

### 🔍 Overview

![Dashboard Overview](https://github.com/Gurpreet-Labana/Smart-Farming-Power-BI-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-05-12%20111855.png)

## 📊 Dashboard Purpose

The goal of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights to greenhouse operators and farm managers by visualizing critical metrics such as:
- Crop yield
- Environmental conditions
- Irrigation efficiency
- Crop health (disease status)
- Geospatial distribution of farm performance

This dashboard was created using the [Smart Farming Crop Yield 2024 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/smart-farming-sensor-data-for-yield-prediction).

## 🧠 Dashboard Logic & Structure

The dashboard is composed of interactive visuals linked via slicers that filter data dynamically by:

- **Region**
- **Crop Type**
- **Irrigation Method**
- **Crop Disease Status**

Each visual is tied to business-relevant logic that helps identify patterns and optimize farming operations:

### ✅ KPI Cards:
| KPI Metric | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Average Yield (kg/ha)** | Indicates overall farm productivity |
| **Average NDVI Index** | Reflects plant health and growth potential |
| **Average Temperature** | Helps correlate climate with yield outcomes |
| **Average Crop Cycle Duration** | Monitors how long crops take to mature |
| **% of Farms with Severe Disease** | Alerts on critical crop health issues |

### 📈 Visual Insights:
- **Yield by Region (Bar Chart)**  
  Compares average yields across regions, color-coded by performance levels.

- **Impact of Irrigation Type (Clustered Column Chart)**  
  Shows how irrigation methods like Drip, Sprinkler, and Manual influence yield.

- **NDVI vs Yield (Scatter Plot)**  
  Highlights the relationship between plant health (NDVI) and actual yield output.

- **Crop Disease Status Distribution (Donut Chart)**  
  Gives an overview of disease prevalence across all farms.

- **Geo Map**  
  Displays spatial distribution of farms, colored by crop disease status and sized by yield, allowing geographic yield analysis.

- **Performance Table**  
  Lists individual farm metrics including yield, NDVI index, and disease status, with conditional formatting for quick scanning.
